***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer:Data structure provides a way of organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently.
With the help of data structure, the data items can be traversed easily. Data structure provides efficiency, reusability and abstraction.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: Insertion: Add a new data item in the given collection of data items.
        Deletion: Delete an existing data item from the given collection of data items.
        Traversal: Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:To implement back functionality in the internet browser. To store the possible moves in a chess game.
 To store a set of ﬁxed key words which are referenced very frequently.
  To store the customer order information in a drive-in burger place.

What is an Array?
Answer:Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable,
 instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer:In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains
a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.


How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer:An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of the same type
in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

What is a Queue?
Answer:  The Queue is used to insert elements at the end of the queue and removes
from the beginning of the queue.

what is stuck?
Answer:

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method assumes that the last unit to
arrive in inventory or more recent is sold first.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer:Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an
algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity).

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The best case complexity is O(1) when element is first or last element in the array.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer:The worst-case performance is when the search item appears
at the end of the list or not at all.

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer:A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes.
Nodes represent value and nodes are connected by edges. A tree has the following
properties: The tree has one node called root.
The tree originates from this, and hence it does not have any parent.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer:A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges.
The edges connect any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as vertices.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer:One of the major differences between HashMap and Hashtable is that HashMap
is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized, which means Hashtable
is thread-safe and can be shared between multiple threads but HashMap can not be shared
between multiple threads without proper synchronization.

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer:HashMap uses multiple buckets and each bucket points to a Singly Linked List
where the entries (nodes) are stored. Once the bucket is identified by the hash function
using hashcode, then hashCode is used to check if there is already a key with
the same hashCode or not in the bucket(singly linked list).


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer:ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access
array element with an illegal index. The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs whenever
we are trying to access any item of an array at an index which is not present in the array.
In other words, the index may be negative or exceed the size of an array.


What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer:You can use a for loop and copy elements of one to another one by one.
       Use the clone method to clone an array.
       Use arraycopy() method of System class.
       Use copyOf() or copyOfRange() methods of Arrays class.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer:BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search.
2. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest
path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses Stack data structure.

What is Recursion?
Answer:In Java, a method that calls itself is known as a recursive method. And, this process is known as recursion.
A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other.
 Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.


What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer:A linear data structure is a type of data structure that arranges the data items in an orderly
 manner where the elements are attached adjacently while a nonlinear data structure is a type
 of data structure that arranges data in sorted order, creating a relationship among the data elements.


Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:

Algorithm	                   Time Complexity
